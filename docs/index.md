# Cloud4RPi Documentation

This website provides documentation for the [Cloud4RPi](https://cloud4rpi.io/) service &mdash; cloud control panel for your IoT projects.

---

## Supported Platforms

Cloud4RPi —Åommunicates practically with any device via the [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) or HTTP protocol. Currently we provide detailed instructions and examples for the following platforms:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/)
- [Next Thing Co. C.H.I.P.](https://getchip.com/pages/chip)
- [Onion Omega2](https://onion.io/omega2/)

If your platform is not listed here, try to follow the instruction for a similar platform. For example, if you have a Debian-based operating system, the [Raspberry Pi instructions](/start/rpi/) will probably work with minimal changes. The operating system of **Omega2** is based on **OpenWRT**, so you should be able to use [Omega2 instructions](/start/o2/) to connect Cloud4RPi to an **OpenWRT**-enabled router.

## Documentation Structure

The **Getting Started** and **How To** sections are different for each platform, use the drop-down menu on these sections to select your platform:
